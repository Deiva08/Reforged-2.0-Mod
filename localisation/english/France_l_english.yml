FRA_armored_cars_equipment_1_short:0 "Lanchester 6x4"
FRA_armored_cars_equipment_1_desc:0 "Developed during the 1920s by the Lanchester Motor Company, the 6x4 had good cross country performance and was easy to maintain. It featured a fully traversing, two-man turret, but the 90 hp engine struggled with the vehicle's weight. First deployed in 1929, it served into the 1930s before being phased out."

FRA_armored_cars_equipment_2_short:0 "Morris CS9"
FRA_armored_cars_equipment_2_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Morris Commercial C9 truck, the CS9 replaced a number of WWI-era designs. The open-top turret usually mounted a 13.7 mm Boys anti-tank rifle, and a 7.62 mm Bren light machine gun. The 94 hp engine gave the vehicle good performance on soft ground - when fitted with the correct tires."

FRA_armored_cars_equipment_3_short:0 "Daimler Mk II"
FRA_armored_cars_equipment_3_desc:0 "A heavier development of the successful Daimler Dingo scout car. Produced in large quantities, their welded, sloped hulls were relatively well armoured, while the 4.1 litre 95 hp engine gave decent performance. The armoured car was equipped with a 2 pdr 40mm gun, and a coaxial 7.92 Besa machine gun."

FRA_armored_cars_equipment_4_short:0 "Humber Mk IV"
FRA_armored_cars_equipment_4_desc:0 "Made by the Rootes Group by combining the Indian Army's Karrier KT4 artillery tractor, with the Guy armoured car. The definitive production Mk IV version mounted a US-made 37 mm gun, and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun. The vehicle had a long career and surplus Humbers were sold all over the world."
FRA_armored_cars_equipment_5:0 "AEC Mk II Armoured Car"
FRA_armored_cars_equipment_5_short:0 "AEC Mk II"
FRA_armored_cars_equipment_5_desc:0 "Built by the Associated Equipment Company on the chassis of their Matador 4x4 artillery tractor. The 158 hp diesel engine enabled the vehicle to mount a 6 pdr 57 mm gun, and coaxial 7.92 mm Besa machine gun, while still maintaining excellent mobility on patrol. The AEC remained valuable for years to come."

FRA_light_tank_equipment_1934_desc:0 "The first dedicated Light Tanks built by Vickers were turreted developments of the widely exported Carden-Loyd Tankette. The Mk III used Horstmann coil suspension, had a Henry Meadows engine, and an electrically actuated turret. It was relatively easy to build and repair in the field, and was popular with the crews."

FRA_light_tank_equipment_1936_desc:0 "Equipped with a Vickers 7.7 mm machine gun, the Mk IV was the definitive early British light tank. Mk IVs served throughout the Commonwealth but quickly became outdated as new designs became available. The Mk IV retained much of the mechanics of the Mk III, but respaced the wheels - removing the idler altogether."

FRA_light_tank_equipment_1938_desc:0 "The first Commonwealth three-man Light Tank in service. The extra crew member, and an updated armament of 7.7 mm and 15 mm Besa machine guns in a twin mount, made the Mk V a far more effective combat vehicle. The increase in weight affected mobility on rough ground somewhat, but overall range was largely unchanged."

The Mk VIa retained the armament of the Mk V, while the Mk VIb had a compact 15 mm Besa and an upgraded 7.92 mm coaxial. The Mk VIc kept the 7.92 mm coaxial, while the main gun was a long barrel 15 mm Besa, which had excellent muzzle velocity but limited punch."

It had a 2 pdr 40 mm gun with a 7.92 mm Besa coaxial, and a new coil suspension system. The light weight of the vehicle coupled with the Meadows 165 hp engine, made the Tetratch fast and easy to transport."

The 2 pdr 37 mm main gun was respectable, though the frontal 7.7 mm Vickers machine gun turrets made the six man tank difficult to command."
