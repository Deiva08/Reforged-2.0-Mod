	#Viktors note for modders and future CDs: If you want to use a stat in the MIOs it has to be in the equipment category itself, not on the battalion level. 
	#So stuff like defense works because its contained within the equipment, but stuff like recon will not work because its owned by the battalion. 
	#Adding stuff like recon will not throw an error, but it will _not_ work. Moving stats to the equipment level from the bat-level might fix this if you are brave enough, 
	#but it is very risk and might break other stuff. Ive commented what is currently on the battalion level below and should not be used with MIOs.
